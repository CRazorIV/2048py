# 2048Py

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60257919-982f-456d-885c-fcf8ae359f8e)


A clone of the popular 2048 game that I created to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and explore GUI development with Python's Tkinter library. This implementation replicates the original game's mechanics and aesthetics while serving as a practical exercise in software development.

**Note: This is a learning project created to practice programming concepts. The code is available for viewing and educational purposes only. No permission is granted for reuse, modification, or distribution of the code.**

## Project Purpose

This clone was developed to:

- Put my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming to practical use
- Gain hands-on experience with Tkinter GUI development
- Practice implementing game logic and state management
- Learn about event handling and user input processing
- Work with matrix operations for game board manipulation

## Implementation Details

The project demonstrates the use of OOP through:

### GUI Implementation (main.py)

- Class-based Tkinter interface
- Event-driven architecture for user inputs
- Dynamic widget management
- Custom styling and layout
- Real-time display updates

### Game Logic (logic.py)

- Board state management using matrix operations
- Move validation and processing
- Score calculation
- Win/lose condition checking
- Random tile generation

## Features

Game mechanics matching the original:

- 4x4 game grid
- Tile merging and movement
- Score tracking
- Win detection at 2048
- Continue option after winning
- Game over detection

Visual elements:

- Clean user interface
- Original color scheme
- Responsive controls
- Score display
- Centered window layout

## Technical Specifications

### Color Scheme

- Background: #faf8ef
- Grid: #bbada0
- Empty Cell: #cdc1b4
- Number Colors: Various shades based on tile value
- Text: #776e65 (dark) and #f9f6f2 (light)

### Controls

- ↑ (Up Arrow): Move tiles up
- ↓ (Down Arrow): Move tiles down
- ← (Left Arrow): Move tiles left
- → (Right Arrow): Move tiles right
